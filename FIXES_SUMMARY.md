# Job Tracker Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Resume Text Visibility Issue ✅
**Problem**: Resume details appeared with white text on white background, making them unreadable.

**Solution**: Created `resume-fix.css` with:
- Dark text (#333) on light background (#f9f9f9) for resume cards
- Proper contrast for all resume elements
- Dark mode support with white text on dark backgrounds
- Fixed CV preview text visibility

### 2. Input Field Colors ✅
**Problem**: Input fields, select boxes, and text areas had white backgrounds instead of appealing gray.

**Solution**: Updated styling in `styles.css` and created `gray-inputs.css`:
- Changed input backgrounds to light gray (#f5f5f7)
- Darker gray (#f0f0f2) on hover/focus
- Dark mode support with dark gray (#2c2c2e)
- Consistent styling across all form elements

### 3. Chrome Extension URL Fix ✅
**Problem**: Extension was pointing to localhost:8080 instead of production Vercel URL.

**Solution**: Updated both `popup.js` and `content.js`:
- Changed URL from old deployment to: `https://job-tracker-chi-eight.vercel.app`
- Set production URL as primary with local fallback for development
- Updated all API endpoints and frontend URLs

### 4. Application Auto-Add Functionality ✅
**Problem**: Applications submitted through Chrome extension weren't automatically appearing in the main tracker.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive integration system:
- Enhanced API service (`api-enhanced.js`) with retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- Chrome extension integration (`chrome-integration.js`) with automatic sync
- Real-time sync between extension storage and main application
- Auto-sync every 30 seconds + manual sync button
- Storage change listeners for immediate updates

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Chrome Extension Integration
- **Auto-sync**: Automatically syncs data between extension and main app
- **Manual sync button**: Added sync button in header for manual updates
- **Real-time notifications**: Shows sync status and success messages
- **Conflict resolution**: Merges data without duplicates using unique IDs

### 2. Improved API Service
- **Retry logic**: Attempts failed API calls up to 3 times
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Uses localStorage when API is unavailable
- **Connection monitoring**: Checks API health and switches between endpoints
- **Offline support**: Full functionality even when servers are down

### 3. Better Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: App continues to work even if some services fail
- **User feedback**: Clear notifications about sync status and errors
- **Automatic recovery**: Retries failed operations automatically
